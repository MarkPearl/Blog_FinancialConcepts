What is the difference between a bond and a NCD.  
 
They both seem to be ways in which  an organization can raise money.  
 
Right now with my superficial understanding I am battling to differentiate between a no-coupon bond and a NCD  

#### Answer ####

A NCD is a fixed rate short term instrument.
 
It’s basically a fixed deposit (Negotiable Certificate of Deposit).  The Negotiable is just the length of the deposit and the rate they get.  So NCD's are initiated by the clients - they want to place money with us and we give them a fixed rate and a term.
 
Bonds are issued by us into the market.  They are generally also Fixed rate, but much longer term (1 year onwards).  They are initiated by us, and people buy them.
 
Generally bonds pay a semi-annual coupon, although a zero-coupon bond is very much like an NCD.  (Interestingly enough, longer term NCD's i.e. greater than 13 months also pay coupons - although they are the exception, not the rule).
 
You also get floating rate bonds (generally called Floating Rate Notes or FRN's)
 
So in summary the main differences between and NCD and a Zero-Coupon Bond is:
1. NCD's are initiated by our clients - we issue bonds and people decide if they want to buy them  
2. NCD's are generally short term (up to a year), Bonds are long term (greater than a year).  
3. Most bonds pay a semi-annual coupon, most NCD's don’t
